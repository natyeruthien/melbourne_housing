# Melbourne Housing Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Melbourne Housing dataset, aiming to predict house prices with minimal Mean Squared Error (MSE). The emphasis is on data preprocessing, feature correlation analysis, and regression modeling.

### Key Objectives
- Perform explanatory preprocessing analysis on housing data features.
- Develop a regression model for accurate house price prediction.
- Analyze feature correlations in the Melbourne housing market.

## Dataset
Data sourced from [Kaggle's Melbourne Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves handling missing values, detecting outliers, and analyzing unique values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Focuses on examining correlations among numerical variables and identifying significant predictors.
- **Model Development**: Implements Linear Regression with various feature selection methods, along with Lasso and Ridge Regression, and other regression models.
- **Evaluation**: Models compared using test errors and cross-validation, with a focus on MSE and model simplicity.

## Results
Key insights into the Melbourne housing market were uncovered, identifying significant predictors for house pricing. The linear model with polynomial terms, based on Cp, emerged as the most effective among the tested models.

## Limitations and Future Work
Acknowledges the need for more comprehensive data and suggests future research to refine models and incorporate additional predictive factors.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: R
